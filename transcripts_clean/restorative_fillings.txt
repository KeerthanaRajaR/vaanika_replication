Today we will discuss restoring a decayed tooth with fillings. Does that mean drilling? Yes, but only the decayed portion; the procedure is painless with local anesthesia. How long does it take? About 30 to 45 minutes. What type of filling will be used? A tooth-colored composite filling for better aesthetics. Will it last? With proper care, it can last many years. Can I eat immediately after? Wait until the numbness wears off and avoid hard foods for a few hours. We will restore the tooth and prevent further decay.
