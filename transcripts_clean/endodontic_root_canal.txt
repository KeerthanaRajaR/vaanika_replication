Good morning, Mrs. Alvarez. I'm Dr. Patel. Please, have a seat. How are you doing today? Morning, doctor. I've been better. That tooth on the upper left has been keeping me up. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see what's going on and get you comfortable. Before we look, can you tell me how long it's been bothering you? It started as a little twinge three weeks ago when I drank cold water. Now it's a throbbing ache that wakes me at night and shoots up to my temple. Classic irreversible pulpitis symptoms. Any heat sensitivity or pressure pain when you chew? Yes, hot coffee makes it scream, and if I bite on a granola bar it feels like the tooth is cracking in half. Got it. Any swelling in your cheek or a bad taste? No swelling, but yesterday I tasted something bitter back there, maybe pus? Possibly. Let's update your health history first. Still on lisinopril for blood pressure? Yes, 10 mg daily. And I take vitamin D3. No allergies. Great. Let's take a look. I'll recline you slightly. Open just a bit and let me use this mirror, perfect. The upper left first molar has a large composite that's breaking down and a tiny fracture line running mesial to distal. Let's do a cold test to confirm. Ouch. That's the one. Electric shock pain that lingers. That linger confirms irreversible pulpitis. Let's get a periapical x-ray. I'll drape the lead apron. Bite down gently on the sensor. Hold still, 1, 2, 3, done. That was quick. Image is up on the screen. See that dark halo around the roots? That's periapical inflammation. The decay's reached the pulp chamber. So it's a root canal, right? I've heard horror stories. Modern endodontics is very different from what your grandparents experienced. I still nervous and it stuck with me. Totally understandable. We can add nitrous oxide or even prescribe a single oral sedative the night before if you like. Maybe the gas. Will I be loopy? You'll feel floaty but awake enough to answer questions. It wears off in 5 minutes so you can drive home. Let's talk you through the procedure so there are no surprises. Please. Step by step helps. First, we isolate the tooth with a rubber dam, thin sheet that keeps saliva out and protects your airway. Then we remove the old filling and any decay. Next, we create a small access cavity on the chewing surface, just enough to reach the canals. This tooth usually has 4 canals, sometimes 5. We locate each one with an apex locator and shape them with nickel-titanium rotary files. Between files we irrigate with sodium hypochlorite to flush out bacteria. Once the canals are clean and shaped, we dry them and place a rubber-like biocompatible material called gutta-percha with sealer to fill the space. Finally, we place a temporary filling. Where does the infection go? The irrigant dissolves the necrotic tissue and the files physically remove it. The sealer entombs any leftover bacteria so your immune system finishes the job. How long will I be numb? I use 4% articaine with 1:100k epi, should give 2-3 hours of anesthesia. We'll give you a post-op sheet explaining soft food diet and no vigorous rinsing today. My sister had a root canal and the tooth cracked 6 months later. That's why we recommend a crown within 4 weeks. After a root canal the tooth becomes brittle, a full coverage crown distributes chewing forces evenly. So 2 procedures? Yes, today's root canal, then crown prep in 4-6 weeks. We can take the crown impression the same visit if your schedule is tight. How much time am I looking at today? 90 minutes tops. Most of that is shaping and cleaning, the actual filling takes 10 minutes. Will I need antibiotics? Not routinely. If there's diffuse swelling or fever we prescribe amoxicillin 500 mg tid x 7 days. You don't have those signs so we stick to ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours as needed. I'm on lisinopril, any drug interaction? NSAIDs can blunt the antihypertensive effect slightly but 3 days at that dose is safe. If you prefer we can switch to acetaminophen, though ibuprofen controls endodontic inflammation better. I'll stick with ibuprofen. How soon before I can run? I'm training for a 10k. Give it 24 hours. Elevated heart rate can transiently increase pulpal pressure and soreness. Got it. What about cost? My insurance is Delta PPO. Our treatment coordinator will run a benefits check, but typical coverage is 80% after deductible. Your portion today is roughly $285 for the root canal and $150 for the crown buildup if needed. That's manageable. And success rate? 95% at 8 years if crowned promptly. The key is not waiting. Let's do it now while I'm motivated. Excellent. I'll have Jen bring in the consent form. Any final questions? Just one, will the tooth turn gray? Sometimes internally. If cosmetics bother you later, we can do internal bleaching or the crown will mask it. Okay, no more questions. Perfect. Let me wash my hands and we'll get started. Jen, can you set up 2% nitrous and prep the 30/.05 taper files? Mrs. Alvarez, slide the nosepiece on and breathe normally. You'll taste cherry flavor. Mm, reminds me of bubblegum ice cream. In about 30 seconds you'll feel warmth. Let me know when your fingers tingle. That tells me we're at the right level. Tingling now. Great. I'll administer the articaine, little pinch. You'll feel heartbeats in your ear, totally normal. Swish with topical rinse first. Now injection, 1, 2, 3, all done. That was easier than my flu shot. Good. We'll wait 4 minutes for full onset. While we wait, Jen will take your blood pressure. 118 over 76, perfect. Let me test with the explorer—no sensation. We ready. I didn't feel that. Excellent. Placing rubber dam—just pressure. You hear a squeak. Try not to swallow, the dam keeps everything dry. Jen, suction, please. Starting access, high-speed handpiece. You'll feel water spray but no pain. Sounds like a tiny jackhammer. Exactly. Access done. Locating canals—4 visible, possibly a fifth. Apex locator beeps, working length 21 mm. Starting rotary glide path. Irrigating, let me know if you taste bleach, we'll suction more. Tastes a bit like pool water. We'll switch to EDTA to neutralize. Shaping canal MB1—done. DB—done. Jen, note we have 2 mesial and 2 distal. Moving to final rinse, using 17% EDTA and chlorhexidine sequence. Drying with paper points. That smells like Christmas trees. That's the eugenol. Placing sealer, gutta-percha cone fit confirmed. Down pack, vertical. Backfill thermoplastic. Temporary IRM placed. Removing dam, bite gently on this cotton roll so the jaw relaxes. It's over? That felt like 15 minutes. 55 minutes chair time. Let me take a final x-ray—perfect taper, no overfill. You did great. Jen will go over post-op instructions. Any soreness? Just feels bruised, like I chewed aluminum. Normal. Keep the ibuprofen schedule, cold compress 10 minutes on, 10 off, the next 4 hours. No crunchy tacos tonight—think yogurt, pasta, scrambled eggs. Easy enough. When do I schedule the crown? Front desk has my open slots. Ideally within a month. If the temporary breaks, call us 24-7 answering service and we'll patch it same day. Thank you, doctor. I wish I'd done this sooner. Most patients say that. You took the hardest step, showing up. We'll see you at the crown prep, and don't forget to keep training for that 10k. Will do. Thanks again.
