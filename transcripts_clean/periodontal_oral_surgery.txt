Good morning, Mrs. Carter. I’m Dr. Ramirez. Please have a seat. How are you today? Morning, doctor. I’ve been okay, I guess. My daughter says I’ve been rubbing my jaw in my sleep. That’s not uncommon. May I confirm your birthdate? March 14, 1962. Perfect. First visit here? Yes. My dentist on the east side retired, so my neighbor recommended you. Welcome. Any new allergies or medications since the form? Still on metoprolol and 81 mg aspirin. No new allergies. I see you circled bleeding gums and a loose lower front tooth. Every time I rinse I see pink. Last week my bridge on the lower right felt wiggly. How long has the bleeding been going on? Maybe six months, heavier the last two. Do you notice bad taste or odor? Yes, especially after coffee. Any pain? Not sharp—more a dull ache after crusty bread. On a scale of 1–10, how’s the anxiety? About a 7. We’ll take this step by step. First, a low-radiation 3-D scan and six bitewings, then gentle periodontal charting with a plastic probe, then we’ll review findings. If you need a break, raise your left hand. You’ll stand still 15 seconds while the machine circles; I’ll drape a lead apron. Now I’ll dry the teeth and walk the probe; numbers are pocket depths in millimetres—1–3 healthy, 4 borderline, 5+ infection. I’m seeing widespread 5–8 mm pockets, heavy plaque, spongy tissue, and your bridge on 29–30 is grade 2 mobile. It’s treatable. Rinse. The purple areas are chronic inflammation—advanced periodontitis, stage 3, grade C. You’ve lost ~40 % of supporting bone around the mandibular anterior sextant, but we can halt progression and retain most teeth. I recommend flap surgery with modified Widman flaps, direct debridement, and possible bone grafting with demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft. Under local anesthetic I reflect small flaps, clean granulation tissue, plane roots, place regenerative material, and suture flaps lower so you can keep them clean. You’ll be awake but numb; nitrous is fine and wears off in 5 minutes. Continue aspirin—stopping could risk your heart. Recovery: soft foods 3–5 days, 7–10 days for soft-tissue healing, 1-week post-op. Expect ~50 % improvement in mobility; if grade 3 persists we can discuss splinting. Cost: roughly $485/quadrant for flap, $425/site for grafting; insurance often covers 50 %. We can phase treatment to fit your $1,500 yearly maximum. First visit 90 minutes for two quadrants. Discomfort peaks at 24 h, manageable with ibuprofen/acetaminophen. I’ll prescribe chlorhexidine rinse—low-alcohol mint version available. Without treatment, bone loss progresses, teeth loosen, and systemic complications arise. With therapy plus home care you can keep teeth for decades. Post-op: water floss on low, ultra-soft sulcular brushing, electric brush with pressure sensor, hard acrylic night guard for clenching. Avoid chips, seeds, popcorn for a week; light walking OK, no heavy lifting 48 h. Site-specific low-dose doxycycline, no systemic clindamycin unless graft complications. Bridge can stay; if decay develops we’ll plan implants later. CareCredit offers 12-month no-interest plans. Next Thursday 2 p.m. works; arrive 15 min early for nitrous consent. Bad breath resolves as pockets and bacteria disappear—usually fresher breath within 3 weeks. My coordinator will print consent, post-op instructions, and cost estimate. See you Thursday.
