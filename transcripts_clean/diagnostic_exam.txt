Good morning, and welcome to SmileCare Dental Clinic. I'm Dr. Ananya, please make yourself comfortable in the chair. How are you feeling this morning? Morning, doctor. I'm okay, I guess, just a bit nervous. It's been, wow, probably five or six years since anyone looked in my mouth. Five or six years is a long gap, but you're here now, that's what matters. Let's start with something easy. While the chair reclines, tell me what you'd like me to call you. Priya is fine. My mom insisted I finally come because I've been wincing every time we have ice cream night. Ice cream night sounds fun, sorry it's been painful. Priya, before we dive in, is there anything specific worrying you about today? Mainly the unknown. I keep imagining the worst case scenario, like maybe every tooth has to come out or something dramatic. Totally understandable. Let me reassure you, today is purely diagnostic. No drilling, no injections, no surprises. We'll go at your pace, and I'll narrate everything as we go. Deal? Deal. That already helps. Excellent. Let's begin with some background. Could you list any medications you take daily? Prescription, over-the-counter, herbal? I take a multivitamin and an iron supplement because my GP said my ferritin was low. Good. Any allergies I should know, latex, metals, medicines? Penicillin gives me hives. That's about it. Noted. Medical conditions, diabetes, blood pressure issues, heart murmur, pregnancy? None of those. My blood pressure was 118 over 78 last week at a pharmacy kiosk. Perfect. Now, on a scale of 1 to 10, how's your pain right now at this moment? Right now it's zero. It's weird, it's like the tooth waits for cold or sometimes sugar, then boom, shoots up to a 6 or 7. Let's capture that. When did you first notice it? Roughly two weeks ago after I bit into a cold granola bar. I thought sensitive toothpaste will fix it but it's getting angrier. Describe the pain quality: sharp, dull, throbbing, electric? At first it's sharp, like someone poking with a needle, then it settles into a dull throb that hangs around a minute or two. Does heat bother it? Hot coffee doesn't seem to trigger it, only cold and sometimes sweet. When the pain fades, does it disappear completely or taper slowly? Taper slowly. I find myself breathing through my mouth so my lip doesn't touch the tooth. Any night pain waking you up? Not yet, thankfully. Good sign. Swelling inside the cheek or any funny taste? A tiny swelling at the bottom left. No bad taste. Has the tooth felt higher when you close, like it touches first? Now that you mention it, yes, feels taller when I bite. Useful clue. Ever had trauma, sport injury, car accident, braces? I wore braces in high school, removed six years ago. No recent knocks. Do you grind or clench? My roommate says I grind. She can hear it at night. We'll talk about a night guard later. Family history of lots of cavities or gum issues? My dad had dentures at 55, mom has crowns on most molars. I figured it's inevitable. Genetics load the gun, but habits pull the trigger, so we can still change that. Let's look. I'll use the dental light, please give me a thumbs up if you need me to stop. Okay. I see some plaque along the lower front lingual surfaces, classic coffee stain pattern. Gums look puffy in the posterior mandible. Let me use the air syringe briefly, tell me when it feels sensitive. There, yes, that molar feels like an ice pick. That's the second molar, 37. I notice a fracture line in the mesial marginal ridge and a deep occlusal cavity. I'm going to tap gently with a mirror handle, just tap, no pressure. Ow, that's sore. And a final test: this is a cold cotton pellet. Raise your hand when the sensation starts and again when it stops. Immediate. Okay, it's fading now. The cold lingered about 25 seconds, borderline irreversible. Let's get an x-ray. I'll place a lead apron with a thyroid collar, radiation is about the same as eating two bananas. Two bananas, nice comparison. Go ahead. Bite on this sensor, perfect, hold still. Done. Let me pull up the image. You can see it on the monitor too. The decay is within 2 mm of the pulp chamber and there's a periapical radiolucency at the mesial root. English, please? The nerve tissue is likely infected and the body has produced a tiny fluid sac at the root tip, classic periapical periodontitis. So I'm not crazy, there really is something brewing. Absolutely. Now let's outline the roadmap. Option 1, root canal therapy to remove the diseased pulp, disinfect, seal, then crown. Option 2, extract and later replace with an implant or bridge. Saving natural tooth is usually first choice because nothing beats biology. Root canal, everyone jokes it's torture. Is it? Modern endodontics with local anesthetic is painless during. Most patients tell me it's easier than a filling because I'm not drilling on the side you bite with. Post-op soreness is like a bruise for a couple days, ibuprofen covers it. Okay, but I'm allergic to penicillin, does that complicate infection control? Good catch. We'd give you clindamycin instead if needed. We also use single-use rotary files and laser disinfection, success rate in my hands is above 95%. The alternative extraction means 3 months healing, then implant surgery, 3 more months, then crown. Time, cost, and you lose proprioception—the tooth can't feel pressure anymore. If we do the root canal, how many visits? Usually 2: first to clean and place an intracanal medicament, second to fill with gutta percha. If the case is complex I bring in an endodontist, we have one upstairs. After that a crown because the tooth becomes brittle. Price tag? At our clinic molar root canal is 800, PFM crown 800, zirconia 1400. Insurance often covers 50%. We can phase it, root canal now, crown next month if budgets are tight. And if I do nothing? The infection can spread into surrounding bone, cause cellulitis, even airway compromise in rare cases. I've admitted patients to hospital for IV antibiotics. Better not to gamble. Point taken. I'm leaning toward saving it. What's today's homework? First, avoid hard or cold stimuli on that side. Brush twice, floss gently, bleeding is okay, it's inflammation leaving. Take ibuprofen 400mg if pain spikes, but not on an empty stomach. If swelling enlarges or you develop fever, call the 24-hour line, we'll start you on antibiotics and move the appointment earlier. I have a business trip next week, can we schedule after? Absolutely. I have a 45-minute slot Thursday at 4 p.m., that gives us leeway if you need an extra visit. We'll also take impressions for a night guard to protect your other teeth from grinding wear. Sounds like a plan. Do I pay today or later? Today's just the diagnostic fee, 800 rupees at reception. We'll collect the treatment fee on the day we start. Our coordinator will email a treatment plan and code so you can confirm insurance. Perfect. One last thing, do white spots on my front teeth mean new cavities? Those look like demineralized enamel, early caries but reversible. I'll prescribe a 0.12% chlorhexidine rinse for one week and fluoride varnish. You'll switch to 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste. With that and the night guard we halt progression. Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. My anxiety dropped from a 9 to a 3. That's the goal. Any other questions, Priya? Not right now. I'll email if anything pops up. Great. I'll walk you to the front desk. Remember, no ice cream tonight, let's keep that molar calm. Deal. See you Thursday. Take care, and welcome to the practice. We'll look after you.
