Good morning, Mrs. Carter. I’m Dr. Ramirez; please have a seat and make yourself comfortable. I see from your intake form that you’re having trouble chewing on the upper left side. Before we begin, how are you doing today? Good morning, Doctor. I’m okay, just frustrated. I lost that back tooth almost a year ago, and every time I eat nuts or steak it feels like my jaw is uneven. I’ve been using the right side so much my TMJ clicks now. Missing a first molar can definitely throw off the balance of your bite, and overloading the other side can aggravate the joint. Let’s get to the bottom of it and find you a solid, long-term solution. Have you had any pain in the area where the tooth is missing? Not sharp pain—more like a dull ache if I chew something hard. I also notice food gets stuck in the gap. Flossing is a nightmare; I keep shredding the floss on the sharp edge of the broken root fragment that’s still there. That fragment can act like a plaque trap and irritate the gum. We’ll take a 3-D scan today to see exactly what’s left and how much bone is available. I see from your last full-mouth X-rays, taken about 18 months ago, that the tooth was extracted after a vertical fracture. Did the previous dentist mention anything about bone grafting at the time? He did, but I had just started a new job and couldn’t swing the extra cost. He said we could revisit it later. I guess later is now. Understood—employment transitions can make timing tough. The good news is that we can still place an implant in most cases even if the extraction site has shrunk; it just might need a minor graft to rebuild the ridge. Let me step out for 30 seconds while my assistant takes a cone-beam CT. You’ll rest your chin on the scanner and the machine rotates around your head; it takes less than 15 seconds. All right. Will the radiation wipe out my thyroid? I read stuff online. Great question. The unit we use is low-dose, and the collar we place shields the thyroid. The exposure is roughly the same radiation you’d get from a short domestic flight—very safe. Scan done, Doctor. Perfect. Let’s have a look together at the screen. Here’s the missing-tooth area in cross-section. The yellow line shows where your sinus floor hangs down, and the blue ruler indicates bone height. At the moment you’ve got about 7 mm of vertical bone; we prefer at least 10 for a standard-length implant, so we’d do a sinus lift to add a couple of millimeters of graft. Width looks fine—about 6 mm—so we’re not looking at major block grafting. Sinus lift? That sounds scary. Will I get a stuffy nose forever? Fair concern. A sinus lift is actually a gentle procedure. We make a small window in the thin bony wall, lift the membrane like a balloon, and tuck some particulate graft material underneath. It adds a platform for the implant. Most patients report sinus pressure similar to a mild cold for a few days, then it resolves. Permanent sinus issues are rare. Okay. How long before I can blow my nose again? We ask you to avoid forceful nose-blowing for two weeks—think dab, don’t honk. After that you’re safe. Sneezing with your mouth open is fine. Good to know. So, the implant itself—how permanent is permanent? My husband jokes that everything in dentistry is permanent until it isn’t. Honesty is healthy. An implant is the closest we have to a lifelong tooth replacement. The titanium post integrates with bone—a process called osseointegration. Studies show 95-plus percent survival at 15 years. The crown that screws on top may need replacement in 10 to 15 years due to wear, but the post itself can last decades if you keep the gum and bone healthy. So it’s not like a hip replacement that they swap out after 20 years? Correct. Unless there’s severe bone loss from gum disease or unusual bite forces, the implant stays put. And the metal won’t set off airport scanners? Dental implants are too small and titanium is non-ferrous, so you won’t beep. All right. Walk me through the steps. I’m a planner. Absolutely. Step 1: today we’ll take your scan, do a quick exam, and review medical history. Step 2: if you’re ready, we can actually extract the remaining root tip under local anesthesia and place a socket graft to preserve width. Step 3: after three months of healing we do the sinus lift and implant placement in the same visit—one sedation appointment. Step 4: three months for integration. Step 5: a small second-stage surgery to expose the implant and place a healing cap. Step 6: two weeks later we take a digital impression and design the crown. Step 7: two weeks after that we screw in your final zirconia crown. Total calendar time: about seven months. Seven months? My cruise is in six. We can fabricate a temporary plastic tooth on a retainer so you can still smile for photos. The implant will be buried under the gum healing, so nothing shows. That works. Pain level—be straight with me. Most patients say the implant placement is easier than the extraction. You’ll feel pressure, not pain. Post-op soreness is 2–3 out of 10, managed with ibuprofen. By day three you’re usually on soft foods and forgetting it happened. I hate ibuprofen; it upsets my stomach. We can prescribe acetaminophen with a little codeine or use a COX-2 inhibitor that’s gentler on the stomach. We’ll tailor it. I grind my teeth at night. Will grinding kill the implant? Good catch. Bruxism creates micromovements that can prevent integration. We’ll make a custom night guard to wear after the crown is in. It also protects your other teeth. Insurance call: I have Delta Premier. What’s covered? Our treatment coordinator will print a breakdown, but in general Delta covers 50 percent of the implant crown up to the cost of a bridge and 80 percent of any grafting if we bill it as bone replacement. Your annual maximum is $1,500, so we time things across two benefit years if needed—December for surgery, January for crown—to maximize benefits. Clever. My birthday’s in January, so the deductible resets anyway. Exactly. We’ll stagger accordingly. Okay, last thing: I read about metal-free implants. Are they better? Zirconia implants exist—they’re ceramic so white, but they’re one-piece, which means we can’t bury them under the gum and angle correction is limited. For back teeth titanium is still the gold standard. If cosmetics on a front tooth were the issue we might discuss zirconia, but in the molar region no one sees it. Fair. Do I need to stop my bisphosphonate for this? You listed alendronate on your form. Because it’s oral, not IV, the risk of osteonecrosis is extremely low. We’ll do a blood test called CTX if you want, but most experts say you can proceed without a drug holiday as long we follow an atraumatic technique. All right. Let’s do it. When’s your next opening? I have a slot this Friday at 8 a.m. We’ll do the root-tip removal, graft, and scan for future guide fabrication—one hour total. My front desk will give you pre-op instructions: soft breakfast, no coffee after midnight if you want oral sedation, and someone to drive you. I can Uber—husband’s out of town. Is that okay? Uber is fine as long as you’re not receiving IV sedation. Oral Valium is okay to go home unescorted if you feel alert; we’ll assess day of. Perfect. Anything I buy ahead—protein shakes? Grab some 0.12 % chlorhexidine mouth rinse, a kid’s soft toothbrush, and some smoothie ingredients. Avoid using a straw for the first two days so you don’t dislodge the clot. Got it. Oh, one more: will antibiotics give me a yeast infection? We’ll place a single dose of slow-release doxycycline powder directly in the site, so systemic exposure is minimal. If you prefer, we can skip tablets altogether and you’ll still be covered. That sounds better. I hate the GI side effects. Understood. Any other questions before we wrap up? I think we covered everything. I’m ready to chew almonds again. Then let’s get you scheduled. I’ll walk you up front, and Mirasol will print the treatment plan and the consent forms. See you Friday—dress comfy, bring your favorite playlist, and we’ll get that foundation started. Thanks, Doctor. I feel a lot better. My pleasure. We’ll take great care of you. Have a wonderful rest of your day, Mrs. Carter.
