Doctor, good morning, Mrs. Peterson. Please, have a seat. I understand you've been experiencing some jaw discomfort. Before we dive in, how are you feeling today? Patient, morning, Dr. Lee. I've been better. The pain comes and goes, but it's been pretty annoying the last few weeks. Doctor, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do to get you comfortable. I've skimmed the intake form, but I'd like to hear it in your own words. Tell me what's been happening. Patient, well, it started maybe two months ago. At first I noticed a little pop when I bit into a sandwich, but I figured I just opened too wide. Then the clicking got more frequent, and now there's this dull ache right in front of my ear that sometimes travels down to my jawline. Doctor, any idea if something triggered it? Stress, a long dental appointment, maybe a fall? Patient, actually, work's been crazy. We launched a new product line and I've been clenching my teeth during meetings without realizing it. My husband says he can hear me grinding at night. Doctor, that's helpful context. Nighttime grinding, bruxism, often partners with temporomandibular joint issues. Have you noticed the pain is worse in the morning, evening, or is it pretty steady? Patient, mornings are rough. I wake up feeling like I've been chewing on a rock. As the day goes on it loosens up, but by late afternoon, especially if I've been talking a lot, it tightens again. Doctor, any limitations when you open or close? For instance, do you ever feel your jaw momentarily lock? Patient, not lock, exactly, but sometimes it feels like it has to hitch past a certain point, before it opens fully. Once I'm past that spot it's fine. Doctor, good description, what we call a soft mechanical interference. Have you tried anything at home, warm compresses, ibuprofen, softer foods? Patient, ibuprofen helps a bit. I switched to soups and yogurt for a week, which seemed to calm things down, but the second I had steak night with friends it flared right back up. Doctor, understood. Any associated symptoms, ear ringing, headaches, neck stiffness? Patient, I've had tension headaches at the base of my skull. No ear ringing, thank goodness. My neck always feels tight, though, I assumed it was from hovering over the laptop. Doctor, laptop posture definitely plays a role. Let's get a proper look. I'll walk you through what I'm doing so nothing surprises you. We'll start with some gentle palpation. Washing hands, lean back for me and relax your shoulders as much as you can. I'm going to place two fingers right in front of your ear. Tell me if anything feels sharp or intolerable. Patient, okay, doc, go ahead. Wow, right there, yeah, that's tender. Doctor, that's the lateral pole of the condyle. I can feel a subtle click as you open. Now slowly open as wide as you comfortably can and close. I noticed a mid deviation to the left. Do you feel that tug? Patient, I do but I thought that was normal. Doctor, it's common but not necessarily normal. We'll grade it in a moment. Next, I'll listen with a stethoscope. Placing scope, open again, nice and slow. There's a crisp reciprocal click, like a soft snap, followed by some crepitus at the end range. That's the disc slipping and cartilage surfaces roughening. Patient, that sounds scary when you put it that way. Doctor, try not to worry. Joints click for lots of reasons, our goal is to figure out if it's progressive and how to quiet it down. Let's check muscle tension. I'm going to press on your temporalis, and now your masseter. Rate the pain 0 to 10. Patient, temporalis is maybe a 2, masseter on the right is a 5. Left side's not bad. Doctor, classic asymmetry, the side you chew on most. Now, let's measure range. Normally we aim for 45 to 50 millimeters. Taking disposable ruler, bite together, then open as far as you comfortably can. I see 38 millimeters with a deflection. That's mild limitation. Patient, is that why I feel like I'm not getting a good stretch when I yawn? Doctor, precisely. Last bit, I'll do a gentle load test. I'm going to support your chin and apply light downward pressure while you open. Any pain or difference? Patient, actually, it feels smoother when you support it. That's weird. Doctor, that's a positive sign. It tells us the joint isn't severely damaged, muscles and ligaments are just overtaxed. All right, let's bring you upright. Based on history and exam, we're looking at anterior disc displacement with reduction, classic TMJ dysfunction, likely stress, and bruxism-driven. Patient, so, is this serious? Do I need surgery? Doctor, in the vast majority of cases, no surgery. It's considered a benign, albeit annoying, condition. The disc is slipping back into place when you open, hence the click. We want to prevent it from progressing to a closed lock, where it stops reducing. Conservative therapy is our first line and is effective about 80-90% of the time. Patient, that's a relief. My neighbor had jaw surgery and was wired shut for weeks, I can't do that with two kids and a job. Doctor, totally understand. Let's outline a plan. First, we'll fabricate a custom hard acrylic splint, often called a Michigan or stabilization splint, for night wear. It keeps your teeth apart so the joint can settle and the disc can glide more smoothly. Patient, will it make me gag? I tried a boil and bite guard once and felt like I was drowning. Doctor, those over-the-counter ones are bulky. Our lab fabricates a slim, custom-fitted device that snaps comfortably over your upper teeth. We'll take impressions today, most patients forget it's in after a night or two. Patient, okay, I can handle that. What about during the day? Can I wear it in meetings? Doctor, correct, night only. For daytime we coach you on joint protection habits: no gum, no pen chewing, cut food into smaller bites, keep caffeine and alcohol moderate since they increase bruxism. We'll also teach controlled jaw posture: lips together, teeth apart, tongue resting on the palate. Patient, teeth apart? I thought they should touch when my mouth is closed. Doctor, common misconception. During waking hours, teeth should only touch when you swallow. Constant contact sends feedback to muscles to keep firing. We'll practice a freeway space of 2-3mm. Patient, got it. What about the stress component? I'm trying meditation apps but I'm inconsistent. Doctor, meditation's great, consistency trumps duration. 2 minutes nightly beats 20 sporadically. We can also prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant like cyclobenzaprine to take at bedtime for 2 weeks. It helps break the pain-spasm cycle and improves sleep quality. Patient, I've taken that once for back pain and was groggy the next day. Doctor, we can halve the dose or switch to a gentler option like magnesium glycinate. Additionally, warm moist compresses for 10 minutes before bed and an anti-inflammatory diet, omega-3 rich fish, leafy greens, can calm joint inflammation. Patient, speaking of inflammation, should I keep taking ibuprofen? Doctor, you can, but limit to 600mg 3 times a day for no more than 5 consecutive days without follow-up. If you have GERD or stomach issues, we'll swap to acetaminophen or topical diclofenac gel. Patient, no stomach problems, thankfully. How soon until I feel improvement? Doctor, most patients report 30-40% relief within 2 weeks of splint delivery and habit changes. Full benefit plateaus around 6-8 weeks. We'll schedule a 2-week phone check and a 4-week chairside follow-up to adjust the splint or add physical therapy. Patient, physical therapy? For my jaw? Doctor, yes. A specialized therapist can do manual joint mobilization, dry needling of trigger points, ultrasound, and teach you isometric exercises to strengthen surrounding muscles. Think of it like rehab for a knee. Patient, my insurance sometimes balks at PT. Is it absolutely necessary? Doctor, not absolutely, but it raises success rates from 70 to 90%. If cost is a barrier, we'll give you printed self-exercises and recommend YouTube channels from accredited orofacial pain centers. Do-it-yourself is better than nothing. Patient, fair enough. What about bite alignment? My front teeth don't quite meet anymore. Doctor, excellent observation. TMJ dysfunction can alter your bite transiently because of muscle guarding. Once inflammation settles, teeth often re-intercuspate. If after 3 months you still have posterior open contacts or feel unstable we may discuss minor orthodontic adjustment or equilibration—selective reshaping of enamel high spots. Patient, braces again? I had them in high school. Doctor, not necessarily full braces. Sometimes a short series of clear aligners just to tip the molars into better support. Or, if it's a minute discrepancy, we polish a few cusps and you're done. We'll reevaluate once joint status is controlled. Patient, okay, I can live with that timeline. Any red flags I should watch for? Doctor, yes. If you wake up one morning and can't open past 20mm, or if the jaw locks shut and you can't get your teeth together, call us immediately. After hours, head to urgent care, we may need to manipulate the disc back. Also, sudden sharp pain with swelling could indicate a perforated disc or rheumatologic issue requiring imaging. Patient, I hadn't thought about arthritis. Could this be rheumatoid? Doctor, at 34 it's unlikely, but will run blood work if symptoms worsen or involve other joints. For now, clinical picture points to mechanical stress. Patient, one more worry, will the clicking ever stop, or am I stuck with it? Doctor, clicking may lessen or stay the same, our main goals are pain-free function and preventing locking. Some patients notice the noise fades after 6 months of splint therapy and stress control. Others live with a benign click for decades. If it's asymptomatic, we don't chase the sound. Patient, understood. How long will the splint last? Doctor, with proper care—cleaning with a soft brush, storing dry, keeping it away from dogs, they love to chew them—it lasts 5 to 10 years. We'll bring you in annually to check for wear and adjust fit. Patient, my shepherd puppy chews everything. I'll keep it in the case. What about cost? Doctor, we'll email a detailed breakdown. As a rough estimate, custom splint plus chair time is around $800. Many PPOs cover 50 to 80%. We offer CareCredit if you prefer monthly payments. Patient, that's manageable. Let's do it. Doctor, great. We'll take upper and lower impressions, a bite record, and photos. Lab turnaround is 10 business days. We'll seat the splint and give you a calibration appointment then. Patient, perfect. Anything else I need today? Doctor, let's review a quick summary handout, joint protection diet, exercises, emergency numbers. Also, I'll send a prescription for the muscle relaxant, start it tonight. Any final questions? Patient, not right now. I'm sure I'll think of something on the drive home. Doctor, totally normal. Our office texts a follow-up link, reply anytime. I'll walk you up front to schedule. Thanks for trusting us, Mrs. Peterson. We'll get that jaw feeling better soon. Patient, thanks, Dr. Lee. See you in a couple of weeks.
