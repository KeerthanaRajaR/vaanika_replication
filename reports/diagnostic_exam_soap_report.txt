### Objective  
**Clinical Examination:**  
- Plaque accumulation on mandibular anterior lingual surfaces

- Tooth #37: fracture line noted on mesial marginal ridge; deep occlusal caries  
- Mild localized gingival edema lower left quadrant  

**Diagnostic Tests:**

**Radiographic Findings:**  
- Decay approximating pulp chamber on Tooth #37  
- Periapical radiolucency consistent with apical periodontitis  

### Assessment  
**Diagnosis:**  
- Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, Tooth #37  

**Risk Assessment:**  
- High risk for progression to acute apical abscess if untreated  

**Prognosis:**  
- Favorable with timely endodontic therapy and definitive restoration  

### Plan  
**Treatment Plan:**  
- Root canal therapy on Tooth #37, followed by full-coverage crown (PFM or zirconia)

- Oral-hygiene reinforcement: 0.12 % chlorhexidine rinse 1 week, fluoride varnish, 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste for demineralized enamel  

**Patient Education:**  
- Avoid hard or cold stimuli until treatment completed  
- Ibuprofen 400 mg as needed for discomfort
