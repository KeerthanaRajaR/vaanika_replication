Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Alvarez. I’m Dr. Patel. Please, have a seat. How are you doing today?

Patient: Morning, Doctor. I’ve been better. That tooth on the upper left has been keeping me up.

Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. Let’s see what’s going on and get you comfortable. Before we look, can you tell me how long it’s been bothering you?

Patient: It started as a little twinge three weeks ago when I drank cold water. Now it’s a throbbing ache that wakes me at night and shoots up to my temple.

Doctor: Classic irreversible-pulpitis symptoms. Any heat sensitivity or pressure pain when you chew?

Patient: Yes, hot coffee makes it scream, and if I bite on a granola bar it feels like the tooth is cracking in half.

Doctor: Got it. Any swelling in your cheek or a bad taste?

Patient: No swelling, but yesterday I tasted something bitter back there—maybe pus?

Doctor: Possibly. Let’s update your health history first. Still on lisinopril for blood pressure?

Patient: Yes, 10 mg daily. And I take vitamin D3. No allergies.

Doctor: Great. Let’s take a look. I’ll recline you slightly. Open just a bit and let me use this mirror—perfect. The upper-left first molar has a large composite that’s breaking down and a tiny fracture line running mesial-to-distal. Let’s do a cold test to confirm.

Patient: Ouch! That’s the one—electric-shock pain that lingers.

Doctor: That linger confirms irreversible pulpitis. Let’s get a periapical X-ray. I’ll drape this lead apron. Bite down gently on the sensor. Hold still—1, 2, 3, done.

Patient: That was quick.

Doctor: Image is up on the screen. See that dark halo around the roots? That’s periapical inflammation. The decay’s reached the pulp chamber.

Patient: So it’s a root canal, right? I’ve heard horror stories.

Doctor: Modern endodontics is very different from what your grandparents experienced. With good anesthesia you should feel pressure, not pain.

Patient: I’m still nervous. I had a bad extraction twenty years ago and it stuck with me.

Doctor: Totally understandable. We can add nitrous oxide or even prescribe a single oral sedative the night before if you like.

Patient: Maybe the gas. Will I be loopy?

Doctor: You’ll feel floaty but awake enough to answer questions. It wears off in five minutes so you can drive home. Let’s talk you through the procedure so there are no surprises.

Patient: Please. Step-by-step helps.

Doctor: First, we isolate the tooth with a rubber dam—thin sheet that keeps saliva out and protects your airway. Then we remove the old filling and any decay. Next, we create a small access cavity on the chewing surface, just enough to reach the canals. This tooth usually has four canals, sometimes five. We locate each one with an apex-locator and shape them with nickel-titanium rotary files. Between files we irrigate with sodium hypochlorite to flush out bacteria. Once the canals are clean and shaped, we dry them and place a rubber-like biocompatible material called gutta-percha with sealer to fill the space. Finally, we place a temporary filling.

Patient: Where does the infection go?

Doctor: The irrigant dissolves the necrotic tissue and the files physically remove it; the sealer entombs any leftover bacteria so your immune system finishes the job.

Patient: How long will I be numb?

Doctor: I use 4% articaine with 1:100k epi—should give two to three hours of anesthesia. We’ll give you a post-op sheet explaining soft-food diet and no vigorous rinsing today.

Patient: My sister had a root canal and the tooth cracked six months later.

Doctor: That’s why we recommend a crown within four weeks. After a root canal the tooth becomes brittle; a full-coverage crown distributes chewing forces evenly.

Patient: So two procedures?

Doctor: Yes—today’s root canal, then crown prep in four to six weeks. We can take the crown impression the same visit if your schedule is tight.

Patient: How much time am I looking at today?

Doctor: Ninety minutes tops. Most of that is shaping and cleaning; the actual filling takes ten minutes.

Patient: Will I need antibiotics?

Doctor: Not routinely. If there’s diffuse swelling or fever we prescribe amoxicillin 500 mg tid × seven days. You don’t have those signs, so we’ll stick to ibuprofen 600 mg every six hours as needed.

Patient: I’m on lisinopril—any drug interaction?

Doctor: NSAIDs can blunt the antihypertensive effect slightly, but three days at that dose is safe. If you prefer, we can switch to acetaminophen, though ibuprofen controls endodontic inflammation better.

Patient: I’ll stick with ibuprofen. How soon before I can run? I’m training for a 10K.

Doctor: Give it twenty-four hours. Elevated heart rate can transiently increase pulpal pressure and soreness.

Patient: Got it. What about cost? My insurance is Delta PPO.

Doctor: Our treatment coordinator will run a benefits check, but typical coverage is 80% after deductible. Your portion today is roughly $285 for the root canal and $150 for the crown build-up if needed.

Patient: That’s manageable. And success rate?

Doctor: Ninety-five percent at eight years if crowned promptly. The key is not waiting.

Patient: Let’s do it now while I’m motivated.

Doctor: Excellent. I’ll have Jen bring in the consent form. Any final questions?

Patient: Just one—will the tooth turn gray?

Doctor: Sometimes internal staining occurs. If cosmetics bother you later, we can do internal bleaching or the crown will mask it.

Patient: Okay, no more questions.

Doctor: Perfect. Let me wash my hands and we’ll get started. Jen, can you set up 2% nitrous and prep the 30.05 taper files? Mrs. Alvarez, slide the nosepiece on and breathe normally. You’ll taste cherry flavor.

Patient: Mmm, reminds me of bubblegum ice cream.

Doctor: In about thirty seconds you’ll feel warmth. Let me know when your fingers tingle. That tells me we’re at the right level.

Patient: Tingling now.

Doctor: Great. I’ll administer the articaine—little pinch. You’ll feel heartbeats in your ear, totally normal. Swish with topical rinse first. Now injection—one, two, three, all done.

Patient: That was easier than my flu shot.

Doctor: Good. We’ll wait four minutes for full onset. While we wait, Jen will take your blood pressure—118/76, perfect. Let me test with the explorer—no sensation. We’re ready.

Patient: I didn’t feel that.

Doctor: Excellent. Placing rubber dam—just pressure. You’ll hear a squeak. Try not to swallow; the dam keeps everything dry. Jen, suction, please. Starting access—high-speed handpiece. You’ll feel water spray but no pain.

Patient: Sounds like a tiny jackhammer.

Doctor: Exactly. Access done. Locating canals—four visible, possibly a fifth. Apex-locator beeps—working length 21 mm. Starting rotary glide path. Irrigating—let me know if you taste bleach, we’ll suction more.

Patient: Tastes a bit like pool water.

Doctor: We’ll switch to EDTA to neutralize. Shaping canal MB1—done. DB—done. Jen, note we have two mesial and two distal. Moving to final rinse—using 17% EDTA and chlorhexidine sequence. Drying with paper points.

Patient: That smells like Christmas trees.

Doctor: That’s the eugenol. Placing sealer—gutta-percha cone fit confirmed. Down-pack vertical. Back-fill thermoplastic. Temporary IRM placed. Removing dam—bite gently on this cotton roll so the jaw relaxes.

Patient: It’s over? That felt like fifteen minutes.

Doctor: Fifty-five minutes chair time. Let me take a final X-ray—perfect taper, no overfill. You did great. Jen will go over post-op instructions. Any soreness?

Patient: Just feels bruised, like I chewed aluminum.

Doctor: Normal. Keep the ibuprofen schedule, cold compress ten minutes on, ten off, the next four hours. No crunchy tacos tonight—think yogurt, pasta, scrambled eggs.

Patient: Easy enough. When do I schedule the crown?

Doctor: Front desk has my open slots. Ideally within a month. If the temporary breaks, call us 24/7 answering service and we’ll patch it same day.

Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I wish I’d done this sooner.

Doctor: Most patients say that. You took the hardest step—showing up. We’ll see you at the crown prep, and don’t forget to keep training for that 10K.

Patient: Will do. Thanks again.
