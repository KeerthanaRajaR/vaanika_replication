Doctor: Based on your X-ray, we recommend a root canal treatment.

Patient: I’ve heard root canals are painful.

Doctor: That’s a myth. With anesthesia, it’s comfortable.

Patient: What exactly happens during the procedure?

Doctor: We remove the infected pulp, clean the canal, and seal it.

Patient: How long will it take?

Doctor: About 60 to 90 minutes.

Patient: Will I need medication?

Doctor: You can take ibuprofen if needed. Avoid exceeding the daily dose.

Patient: Is the tooth saved after this?

Doctor: Yes, the tooth remains functional.

Patient: That’s reassuring.

Doctor: We’ll schedule the procedure and follow up afterward.
