Doctor: Welcome back. Today we’ll talk about preventive dental hygiene. How often do you brush your teeth?

Patient: Twice a day, but I’m not very regular with flossing.

Doctor: Flossing is important to remove plaque between teeth where brushing cannot reach.

Patient: I didn’t know that much food gets stuck there.

Doctor: Yes, plaque buildup can lead to gum disease and cavities. Do your gums bleed while brushing?

Patient: Sometimes yes.

Doctor: That indicates early gingivitis. Regular cleaning can reverse it.

Patient: What should I do daily?

Doctor: Brush twice daily with fluoridated toothpaste, floss once daily, and rinse with mouthwash.

Patient: How often should I come for cleaning?

Doctor: Every six months is ideal.

Patient: Does cleaning damage teeth?

Doctor: No, professional scaling removes harmful deposits and protects your teeth.

Patient: That sounds good.

Doctor: We’ll schedule your scaling appointment and provide hygiene instructions.
