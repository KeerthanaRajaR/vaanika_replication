 Doctor, Good morning, Mrs. Patel. It's great to see you again, how have you been since your last visit in January? Patient, morning, Dr. Lee I've been okay, just juggling work and the kids My youngest started teething, so sleep's been a luxury. Doctor, I remember those days with my twins, definitely a marathon. Let's make today's visit as relaxing as possible. Before we dive in, anything new with your health or medications since we last spoke? Patient, nothing major I started a vitamin D supplement because my levels were low and I'm still on the same blood pressure pill. Doctor, perfect, thanks for letting me know Today we're focusing on preventive hygiene, but if anything's bothering you we'll address that first. Any tooth pain, sensitivity, or changes you've noticed? Patient, well, I've been getting this twinge on the upper left side when I drink cold water. It's not a sharp pain, more like a quick zing that fades in seconds. Doctor, I'll note that and we'll take a close look Cold zingers often indicate either cervical dentin exposure or possibly a crack that hasn't propagated fully We'll check it after your routine exam While we're talking prevention, how often are you brushing? Patient, I brush twice a day, once after breakfast and once right before bed. I'm pretty good about that because I set phone alarms Doctor, excellent discipline And how long do you spend each time? I usually recommend two full minutes. Patient, honestly, probably 45 seconds The kids start banging on the door and I rush Doctor, totally understandable We'll talk about some tricks to stretch that to 2 minutes, an electric brush with a timer or even a 2 minute song How about flossing? Patient, that's my downfall. I floss maybe twice a week and only when I feel something stuck. Doctor, you're not alone, surveys show about 60% of adults skip daily flossing. The challenge is that plaque forms a sticky biofilm between teeth within 24 hours. Brushing can't slip into that tight embrasure space, so the bacteria party continues untouched Patient, I didn't realize plaque built up that fast I thought if I can't see anything, it must be clean Doctor, it's microscopic at first, think of it like dust on furniture. You don't notice day one, but give it a week and it's visible. Same concept, except plaque bacteria produce acids that demineralize enamel and irritate the gums. Speaking of which, do your gums ever bleed when you brush or floss? Patient sometimes in the front especially when I brave enough to floss after skipping a few days It a little pink in the sink Doctor that your gingiva telling you it inflamed Early gingivitis is totally reversible with consistent plaque removal We confirm that with a quick probing in a minute Any bad taste or odor you notice in the mornings? Patient, occasionally my husband mentions morning breath, but I thought everyone had that. Doctor, true, morning breath is normal, but if it lingues after brushing or returns quickly it can indicate bacterial overgrowth on the tongue or between teeth. We'll evaluate that as well Let's recline the chair and take a look I'll start with a visual exam and some photos so you can see what I see Patient, sounds good I like seeing the pictures, it makes it real Doctor, great. Sound of chair reclining, I'm going to use the interworld camera first. You'll see the live feed on the monitor. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Pause, okay, you can see some cervical plaque along the lower anteriors, those yellowish flecks right at the gumline. That's where saliva pools and minerals can harden into calculus if we leave it. Patient, I can see it. I thought that was just staining from coffee. Doctor, coffee stains are more diffuse brown discoloration. This is localized and slightly grainy. When we scale, it'll come off easily. Now I'm checking for recession. You've got about 1mm on 24 and 25, that's still within normal for your age, but we You want to watch it. Can you turn slightly toward me? Perfect. I notice some very subtle craze lines on the canine, nothing to treat, just wear patterns from function. Let's measure your probing depths now Patient, will it hurt? I remember years ago it pinched Doctor, we use plastic tipped probes now that are gentler, and I'll go slowly. If you feel anything sharp, raise your left hand. Pause, you're doing great Most pockets are 2-3mm, which is healthy A couple of 4mm pockets distally on the molars, again where floss may be missing. Patient, I definitely don't floss the back teeth well It feels awkward Doctor, that's common We'll show you some floss holder options and interproximal brushes Okay, let's do a quick bitewing x-ray set to check for interproximal caries and bone levels. Clicking sound, all done You can rinse while the images load Patient, thank you That was easier than I expected Doctor, technology keeps improving Let's look at your x-rays together. Mouse-clicking, see these contacts here, no radiolucencies, so no cavities between. Bone crests look sharp which indicates good periodontal health However I do see some subgingival calculus spicule on the lower left molar That probably contributing to the 4mm pocket Patient so even though I brushing I still getting calculus Doctor, unfortunately, yes. Saliva contains calcium phosphate that precipitates on any remaining plaque. Once it's hardened, only professional instruments can remove it. Think of it like barnacles on a ship, you can scrub the hull, but you need a scraper once they calcify Patient, makes sense So if I floss daily, can I prevent it completely? Doctor, daily flossing plus professional cleanings dramatically reduce it, but most adults still accumulate a thin band over 6 months. Genetics and saliva composition play roles too. Our goal is to keep it minimal so your gums stay inflammation-free. Patient, okay, I'm motivated What should my daily routine look like? Doctor, ideal routine, brush twice daily with a soft bristle brush, manual or electric, for 2 minutes using a fluoridated dentifrice. Spit but don't rinse with water afterwards so the fluoride stays on the enamel longer. Floss once a day, preferably before bed so your mouth is clean overnight. Pull a fresh segment for each interdental space, curve it in a C-shape, and slide under the contact. If you hate string floss, consider a water flosser or interproximal brush a size 0.6mm, finish with an alcohol-free fluoride mouth rinse. And don't forget to brush your tongue, bacteria love the papilla. Patient, I've tried floss picks, but they feel thick. Do they still work? Doctor, standard floss picks are okay for on the go, but the segment is fixed, so you may transfer plaque from space to space. They're better than nothing. For home use, individual floss or interproximal brushes are superior. We can give you samples to test what feels comfortable. Patient, how about diet? I snack on dried fruit with the kids. Doctor, dried fruit is sticky and high in fermentable carbs If you snack, pair it with cheese or nuts, the protein and fat buffer acids. Drink water afterward Avoid continuous sipping of sweet coffee or soda throughout the day, each sip resets the acid clock for 20 minutes Patient, I do that with iced tea I'll switch to unsweetened and limit to mealtimes Doctor, smart choice Let's circle back to that cold sensitivity you mentioned. I applied some air and saw the cervical recession We'll polish with desensitizing paste today and place a fluoride varnish that should help seal the dentinal tubules If the zing persists after two weeks we can discuss a more permanent desensitizer or even a bonded filling Patient good to know Does whitening make sensitivity worse Doctor peroxide can open the tubules temporarily so we manage that carefully lower concentration shorter time and desensitizer pre We can whiten after we stabilize your gums. Patient, okay. How often do I need cleanings? Doctor, for most healthy adults every 6 months Given your early signs of localized gingivitis and slight calculus, let's keep you on that schedule for now. If inflammation resolves and home care stays consistent, we might extend to 9 months. Conversely, if plaque builds faster, we can drop to 4 months Patient, my insurance only covers twice a year Doctor, we'll provide a predetermination so you know any out-of-pocket difference. The additional cleaning is usually modest compared to treating gum disease later. Patient, true Does scaling scratch the enamel? Doctor, modern ultrasonic tips use vibration and water, not abrasion Hand scalers are sharp but we keep them sharp so they lift calculus rather than scrape enamel After removal we polish with a fine prophy paste that smooths the surface and makes it harder for plaque to stick Patient, that's reassuring I always worried it thins the teeth Doctor, it's a common myth In fact, leaving calculus leads to bone loss, which weakens support. Prevention is kinder to your teeth and neglect Patient, one more thing, what about my kids? My five-year-old hates brushing Doctor, make it playful, use a sand timer or an app with a cartoon Let her choose a toothbrush color. Brush together as a family so she mimics you. Only a pea-sized smear of fluoride paste, and you finish for her to ensure 2 minutes. First dental visit should be around age 1 or when first tooth erupts. Patient, my toddler already has spaces Do I still floss his teeth? Doctor, if you see touching surfaces, yes For wide spaces, a soft kid's brush suffices We'll gladly show you both when you bring them. Doctor, let's summarize, today we'll do a full mouth scaling and polish, apply fluoride varnish, and give you hygiene aids. Schedule 6 month recall. I'll email a one-page summary with product links. Any other questions? Patient, no, I think I'm set. Thanks for being so thorough. Doctor, my pleasure. I'll hand you to Sandra at reception. She'll set your next appointment and give you that sample bag. Remember, give the floss a two-week trial, your gums may bleed at first, keep going and it will subside. See you in 6 months, and enjoy the rest of your day. Patient, will do. Thanks again, Dr.
