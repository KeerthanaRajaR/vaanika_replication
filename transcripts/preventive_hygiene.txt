 Doctor, welcome back. Today we'll talk about preventive dental hygiene. How often do you brush your teeth? Patient, twice a day, but I'm not very regular with flossing. Doctor, flossing is important to remove plaque between teeth where brushing cannot reach. Patient, I didn't know that much food gets stuck there. Doctor, yes, plaque buildup can lead to gum disease and cavities. Do your gums bleed while brushing? Patient, sometimes yes. Doctor, that indicates early gingivitis. Regular cleaning can reverse it. Patient, what should I do daily? Doctor, brush twice daily with fluoridated toothpaste, floss once daily, and rinse with mouthwash. Patient, how often should I come for cleaning? Doctor, every six months is ideal. Patient, does cleaning damage teeth? Doctor, no, professional scaling removes harmful deposits and protects your teeth. Patient, that sounds good. Doctor, we'll schedule your scaling appointment and provide hygiene instructions.
