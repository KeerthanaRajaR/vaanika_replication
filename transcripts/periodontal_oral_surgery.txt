 Doctor, Good morning, Mrs. Carter. I'm Dr. Ramirez. Please, have a seat. How are you doing today? Patient, morning, doctor I've been okay, I guess A little nervous, my daughter says I've been rubbing my jaw in my sleep Doctor, that's not uncommon Before we dive in, can you confirm your birth date for me? Patient, March 14, 1962 Doctor, perfect First visit here, correct? Patient, yes. My dentist on the east side retired, so my neighbor recommended you. Doctor, welcome, Ben Let's start with the basics Any new allergies or medications since the health update form you filled out? Patient, still on metoprolol for blood pressure and 81 mg aspirin No new allergies Doctor, great I see you circled bleeding gums and loose lower front tooth on the form Tell me more Patient, well, every time I rinse I see pink in the sink Last week my bridge on the lower right felt wiggly, so I pressed on it and it moved. That scared me Doctor, understandable How long has the bleeding been going on? Patient, maybe 6 months, but it's gotten heavier the last 2 I thought I was brushing too hard Doctor, do you notice bad taste or odor? Patient, yes, especially after coffee My grandson told me my breath smells like the trash can. Kids are honest. Doctor, they certainly are. Any pain? Patient, not sharp pain, more like a dull ache after chewing crusty bread. Doctor, got it. On a scale of 1 to 10, how's the anxiety today? Patient, about a 7. I haven't seen an oral surgeon before, so the word surgery rattles me. Doctor, totally normal. We'll take this one step at a time. Let me explain what we'll do. First, we'll take a low-radiation 3D scan and 6 bitewings so I can see bone levels. Then I'll do a gentle periodontal charting with a plastic probe so we don't add trauma Last, we'll sit upright and talk findings before anything else Patient, okay No surprises? Doctor, no surprises If at any point you need a break, raise your left hand and we'll stop. Patient, deal Doctor, let's start with the scan You'll stand still for about fifteen seconds while the machine circles your head I'll drape a lead apron for protection Machine hum softly Patient, that was quick Doctor, technology helps Now lean back I'm just going to dry your teeth with air so the probe glides Patient chuckles cold Doctor sorry short blast You feel me walking the probe around each tooth Numbers you hear me call out are pocket depths in millimeters 1 is healthy 4 is borderline 5 and up signals infection Patient, got it Dr. 3-3-4, 3-3-2, 5-6-7. Mrs. Carter, I'm seeing widespread 5-8mm pockets, It's, especially around the lower incisors and molars. Heavy plaque retention, spongy tissue, and yes, your bridge on 29-30 is grade 2 mobile. Patient, that doesn't sound good Doctor, it's treatable Let me finish charting, then we'll talk solutions Two minutes of charting Doctor, all done. Rinse with this lukewarm water. I'm placing a mirror so you can see Patient, my gums look purple in spots Doctor, that's chronic inflammation The color change comes from increased blood flow and venous stasis. You're looking at advanced periodontitis, stage 3, grade C, rapid rate. Patient, Stage 3? I didn't know there were stages. Doctor, we classify based on bone loss, age, and systemic factors. You've lost approximately 40% of the supporting bone around the mandibular anterior sextant. The good news, we can help progression and retain most teeth. Patient, so surgery? Doctor, minor periodontal surgery, yes I'd recommend flap surgery with modified Widman flaps, direct vision debridement, and possible bone grafting using demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft. We'd also reposition the soft tissue collar to reduce pocket depth Patient, that's a mouthful. Walk me through it. Doctor, under local anesthetic, I reflect small gum flaps, clean granulation tissue, plain root surfaces with ultrasonic and hand instruments, then place regenerative material where bone was lost. Finally, I suture the flaps at a lowered level so you can keep them clean Patient, will I be awake? Doctor, fully awake but numb If you prefer light sedation, we can arrange oral valium or nitrous Patient, Valium might help I drive myself, would that be okay? Dr. With oral valium you'll need a driver. Nitrous wears off in 5 minutes, so you could drive Which appeals? Patient, let's stick with nitrous. Doctor, excellent We'll place a nasal hood, you'll feel floaty in 30 seconds, and when we're done I give you 5 minutes of pure oxygen and you're clear-headed Patient, how about bleeding? Doctor, I use microsurgical blades and 6-0 resorbable sutures. Most patients notice only a pink tinge on the gauze for a couple of hours. I take aspirin daily Should I stop Doctor continue it Current evidence shows minimal impact on periodontal surgery bleeding and stopping could risk your heart We'll use local hemostatic foam if needed. Patient, Recovery Time? Dr. Soft tissue heals in 7-10 days. We'll see you at one week to remove any remaining sutures and polish roots. You'll eat soft foods, scrambled eggs, pasta, smoothies, 3-5 days, then gradually return to normal. Patient, will the loose tooth tighten? Doctor, we expect about a 50% improvement in mobility once inflammation resolves. If it remains grade 3 mobile after 6 months, we can discuss splinting or replacement. Patient, cost? Doctor, I'll have our treatment coordinator give you the breakdown. As a rough guide, per quadrant flap is $485, grafting adds $425 per site. Insurance often covers 50%. We can phase treatment, do two quadrants now, two later if budget is tight Patient, my employer plan has a $1,500 yearly max. Can we fit within that? Doctor, very doable We'll prioritize the lower anterior area first since that's where your bridge is failing. Patient, how long will I be in the chair? Doctor, about 90 minutes for the first two quadrants, including nitrous recovery Patient, will it hurt tomorrow? Doctor, most discomfort peaks at 24 hours and feels like a pizza burn Alternate ibuprofen and acetaminophen keeps it around 2 out of 10. I'll prescribe a chlorhexidine rinse to keep bacteria at bay while you heal Patient, I hate the taste of that rinse Doctor, we can compound a low-alcohol version with mint oil. Tastes like strong mouthwash Patient, better What happens if I do nothing? Doctor, bone loss progresses, more teeth loosen, infection can enter the bloodstream and complicate diabetes or heart disease. Eventually tooth loss becomes inevitable. Patient, my mom lost all hers by 55. I'm 59 and want to keep my teeth Doctor, that's the goal Periodontal therapy plus good home care can preserve teeth for decades Patient, speaking of home care, I floss maybe twice a month Doctor, after surgery we'll set up a nightly routine, water floss or on low, Sulkular brushing with ultra-soft bristles and once inflammation resolves daily floss or interproximal brushes I'll show you angles Patient, electric toothbrush? Doctor, absolutely Choose one with pressure sensor, prevents over-scrubbing Patient, I clench at night Does that matter? Doctor, significantly Clenching overloads the periodontium We make a hard acrylic night guard to wear after stitches dissolve Patient okay Any eating restrictions day of surgery Doctor light breakfast two hours before Nothing hot until numbness wears off to avoid burns. Then lukewarm soups, yogurt, pudding No chips, seeds, or popcorn for a week, they get stuck under flaps Patient, I love popcorn That'll be tough Doctor, swap to puffed rice cakes for 7 days After we clear you, popcorn returns. Patient, how about exercise? Doctor, light walking same day Avoid heavy lifting or jogging for 48 hours, elevated blood pressure can restart bleeding. Patient, I teach Zumba Can I instruct? Doctor, take three days off, then resume at half intensity If you notice throbbing, back off. Patient, understood. Will gums recede more? Doctor, they'll appear longer because we eliminate pockets, but recession is healthier than deep infection. If aesthetics bother you later, we can discuss pinhole grafts Patient, I'd rather have long teeth than no teeth Doctor, attitude helps success Any other concerns? Patient, will I need antibiotics? Doctor, for advanced cases I place site-specific low-dose doxycycline to calm enzymes, not for infection. You won't need systemic clindamycin unless we hit bone graft complications. Patient, I'm allergic to penicillin. Doctor, noted. We avoid that class anyway. Patient, what about my bridge, does it come off? Doctor, I can work around it, but if decay shows up underneath, we might section and convert to individual implants later. We'll plan that separately. Patient, sounds expensive. Doctor, we'll face treatment and maximize insurance each year. Care credit offers no interest 12-month plans if you qualify Patient, okay When can we schedule? Doctor, I have next Tuesday at 8am or Thursday at 2pm Patient, Thursday works My son can drive me Doctor, perfect We'll confirm with text reminders Arrive 15 minutes early for nitrous consent Patient, one last thing, after I heal, will the bad breath go away? Doctor, eliminating bacteria and pockets removes the sulfur gases causing odor. Most patients notice fresher breath within three weeks. Patient, my grandson will appreciate that Doctor, he'll give you a thumbs up Let me walk you to our coordinator, and she'll print the consent, post-op instructions, and cost estimate. Patient, thank you, doctor. I feel better. Doctor, you're welcome, Mrs. Carter. We'll take great care of you. See you Thursday.
