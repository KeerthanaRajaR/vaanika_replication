 Doctor, good morning. This is Dr. Ananya, dentist at SmileCare Dental Clinic. Please have a seat. How are you feeling today? Patient, good morning, doctor. I'm okay, but honestly a bit anxious. I haven't been to a dentist in a long time. Doctor, that's completely understandable. Many patients feel the same way. Don't worry, today's visit is just a diagnostic examination. We'll take it step by step and nothing will be done without explaining it to you first. Patient, that makes me feel better, thank you. Doctor, you're welcome. Let's start with some basic questions. What brings you in today? Patient, I've been having pain on the lower left side of my mouth for the past two weeks. It's not constant, but it comes and goes. Doctor, all right. When the pain occurs, how would you describe it? Is it sharp, dull, or throbbing? Patient, most of the time it's a dull ache, but sometimes when I drink something cold, it suddenly becomes very sharp. Doctor, I see. Does the pain linger after drinking something cold or does it go away quickly Patient it usually stays for a minute or two and then slowly fades Doctor that helpful information Have you noticed any swelling in that area Patient, yes, just a little bit. Not very obvious, but I can feel it with my tongue. Doctor, any fever, headache, or difficulty opening your mouth? Patient, no fever or headache. Opening my mouth is fine. Doctor, good. Are you currently taking any medications? Patient, just occasional painkillers when the pain becomes uncomfortable. Doctor, all right. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma? Patient, no, I don't have any medical conditions. Doctor, any allergies to medications? Patient, yes, I'm allergic to penicillin. Doctor, thank you for letting me know. That's important. Now I'm going to do an oral examination. Please open your mouth slowly. Patient, okay, doctor. Doctor, I'm checking your gums, teeth, and oral tissues. You might feel slight pressure but no pain. Let me know if you feel uncomfortable. Sure Doctor I can see some plaque buildup along the gum line especially on the lower teeth Your gums look slightly inflamed in that area I also notice a deep cavity on the lower left molar Patient is that bad Doctor it means the tooth has decay that has progressed deeper than the surface. I'm going to gently tap the tooth now. Tell me if it hurts. Patient, ouch, yes, that feels sensitive. Doctor, that sensitivity suggests the tooth nerve may be irritated. This could indicate pulpitis, which is inflammation of the dental pulp. Patient, that sounds serious. Is it dangerous? Doctor, it can become serious if left untreated, but we've caught it at a manageable stage. To confirm the diagnosis, I'll need to take a dental x-ray. Patient, is the x-ray safe? Doctor, yes, it's completely safe. The radiation exposure is minimal. We also use protective shielding. Patient, okay, I'm fine with that. Doctor, great. Please bite down gently on this sensor and stay still for a few seconds. Patient, alright. Doctor the x is done Let me take a look Alright I can see decay close to the pulp and mild infection near the root apex of the tooth Patient so what does that mean for me Doctor based on this examination the tooth may need a root canal treatment to remove the infected pulp and save the tooth. However, we'll confirm the treatment plan after discussing all options. Patient, will the tooth have to be removed? Doctor, at this stage, no. The tooth can most likely be saved, which is always our goal. Patient, that's a relief. Doctor, for now, this visit is only diagnostic. I'll document all findings, and we'll plan the next steps. Do you have any questions so far? Patient, just one. Is there anything I should avoid doing until the next appointment? Doctor, yes. Avoid chewing on the left side, especially hard foods. Try to maintain good oral hygiene and let us know if the pain worsens or if swelling increases. Patient, okay, I'll do that. Doctor, excellent. We'll schedule your next visit for treatment discussion and planning. Thank you for coming in today. Patient, thank you, doctor. I feel much more informed now. Doctor, you're welcome. Take care, and we'll see you soon.
