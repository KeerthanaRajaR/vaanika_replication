 Doctor, you mentioned jaw pain and clicking sounds. Patient, yes, especially while opening my mouth. Doctor, this could be related to TMJ disorder. Patient, is it serious? Doctor, usually manageable with therapy and splints. Patient, do I need surgery? Doctor, no, conservative treatment is enough initially. Patient, what about alignment issues? Doctor, orthodontic treatment can help improve bite balance. Patient, that sounds good.
