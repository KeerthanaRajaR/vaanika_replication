 Doctor, based on your x-ray, we recommend a root canal treatment. Patient, I've heard root canals are painful. Doctor, that's a myth. With anesthesia, it's comfortable. Patient, what exactly happens during the procedure? Doctor, we remove the infected pulp, clean the canal, and seal it. Patient, how long will it take? Doctor, about 60 to 90 minutes. Patient, will I need medication? Doctor, you can take ibuprofen if needed. Avoid exceeding the daily dose. Patient, is the tooth saved after this? Doctor, yes, the tooth remains functional. Patient, that's reassuring. Doctor, we'll schedule the procedure and follow up afterward.
