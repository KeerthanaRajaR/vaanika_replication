 Doctor, good morning, Mrs. Alvarez. I'm Dr. Patel. Please, have a seat. How are you doing today? Patient, morning, doctor. I've been better. That tooth on the upper left has been keeping me up. Doctor, I'm sorry to hear that Let's see what's going on and get you comfortable Before we look, can you tell me how long it's been bothering you? Patient, it started as a little twinge three weeks ago when I drank cold water. Now it's a throbbing ache that wakes me at night and shoots up to my temple. Doctor, classic irreversible pulpitis symptoms Any heat sensitivity or pressure pain when you chew? Patient, yes, hot coffee makes it scream, and if I bite on a granola bar it feels like the tooth is cracking in half. Doctor, got it. Any swelling in your cheek or a bad taste? Patient, no swelling, but yesterday I tasted something bitter back there, maybe pus? Doctor, possibly. Let's update your health history first. Still on lisinapril for blood pressure? Patient, yes, 10 mg daily. And I take vitamin D3. No allergies Doctor, great Let's take a look I'll recline you slightly Open just a bit and let me use this mirror, perfect The upper left first molar has a large composite that's breaking down and a tiny fracture line running mesial to distal. Let's do a cold test to confirm. Patient, ouch. That's the one, Electric shock pain that lingers Doctor, that linger confirms irreversible pulpitis Let's get a periapical x-ray I'll drape the sled apron Bite down gently on the sensor. Hold still, 1, 2, 3, done. Patient, that was quick. Doctor, image is up on the screen See that dark halo around the roots? That's periapical inflammation. The decays reached the pulp chamber. Patient, so it's a root canal, right? I've heard horror stories. Dr. Modern endodontics is very different from what your grandparents experienced. I still nervous and it stuck with me Doctor totally understandable We can add nitrous oxide or even prescribe a single oral sedative the night before if you like Patient maybe the gas Will I be loopy? Doctor, you'll feel floaty but awake enough to answer questions It wears off in 5 minutes so you can drive home Let's talk you through the procedure so there are no surprises. Patient, please. Step by step helps. Doctor, first, we isolate the tooth with a rubber dam, thin sheet that keeps saliva out and protects your airway. Then we remove the old filling and any decay. Next, we create a small access cavity on the chewing surface, just enough to reach the canals. This tooth usually has 4 canals, sometimes 5. We locate each one with an apex locator and shape them with nickel-titanium rotary files. between files we irrigate with sodium hypochlorite to flush out bacteria. Once the canals are clean and shaped, we dry them and place a rubber-like biocompatible material called vettipercha with sealer to fill the space. Finally, we place a temporary filling. Patient, where does the infection go? Doctor, the irrigant dissolves the necrotic tissue and the files physically remove it, The sealer entombs any leftover bacteria so your immune system finishes the job. Patient, how long will I be numb? Doctor, I use 4% articane with 1,100k api, should give 2-3 hours of anesthesia. We'll give you a post-op sheet explaining soft food diet and no vigorous rinsing today. Patient, my sister had a root canal and the tooth cracked 6 months later. Doctor, that's why we recommend a crown within 4 weeks. After a root canal the tooth becomes brittle, a full coverage crown distributes chewing forces evenly. Patient, so 2 procedures? Doctor, yes, today's root canal, then crown prep in 4-6 weeks. We can take the crown impression the same visit if your schedule is tight. Patient, how much time am I looking at today? Doctor, 90 minutes tops Most of that is shaping and cleaning, the actual filling takes 10 minutes. Patient, will I need antibiotics? Doctor, not routinely. If there's diffuse swelling or fever we prescribe amoxicillin 500 mg 10 times 7 days. You don have those signs so we stick to ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours as needed Patient I on lisinopril any drug interaction Dr NSAIDs can blunt the antihypertensive effect slightly but 3 days at that dose is safe If you prefer we can switch to acetaminophen though ibuprofen controls endodontic inflammation better Patient, I'll stick with ibuprofen How soon before I can run? I'm training for a 10k. Doctor, give it 24 hours. Elevated heart rate can transiently increase pulpal pressure and soreness. Patient, got it. What about cost? My insurance is delta PPO. Doctor, our treatment coordinator will run a benefits check, but typical coverage is 80% after deductible. Your portion today is roughly $285 for the root canal and $150 for the crown buildup if needed. Patient, that's manageable. And success rate? Doctor, 95% at 8 years if crowned promptly The key is not waiting. Patient, let's do it now while I'm motivated. Doctor, excellent I'll have Jen bring in the consent form Any final questions? Patient, just one, will the tooth turn gray? Doctor, sometimes internal If cosmetics bother you later, we can do internal bleaching or the crown will mask it. Patient, okay, no more questions Doctor, perfect Let me wash my hands and we'll get started Jen, can you set up 2% nitrous and prep the 30.05 taper files? Mrs. Alvarez, slide the nosepiece on and breathe normally. You'll taste cherry flavor Patient, mm, reminds me of bubblegum ice cream Doctor, in about 30 seconds you'll feel warmth Let me know when your fingers tingle That tells me we're at the right level Patient, tingling now Doctor, great I'll administer the articane, little pinch You'll feel heartbeats in your ear, totally normal Swish with topical rinse first Now injection, 1, 2, 3, all done Patient, that was easier than my flu shot Doctor, good We'll wait 4 minutes for full onset While we wait, Jen will take your blood pressure, 118 over 76, perfect Let me test with the explorer no sensation We ready Patient I didn feel that Doctor excellent Placing rubber dam just pressure You hear a squeak Try not to swallow, the dam keeps everything dry Gen, suction, please Starting access, high-speed handpiece You'll feel water spray but no pain Patient, sounds like a tiny jackhammer Doctor, exactly Access done Locating canals, 4 visible, possibly a fifth Apex locator beeps, working length 21mm starting rotary glide path Irrigating, let me know if you taste bleach, we'll suction more Patient, tastes a bit like pool water Doctor, we'll switch to EDTA to neutralize Shaping Canal MB1, done DB, done Gen, note we have 2 mesial and 2 distal Moving to final rinse, using 17% EDTA and chlorhexidine sequence Drying with paper points Patient, that smells like Christmas trees Doctor, that's the eugenol Placing sealer, gutta perch a cone fit confirmed Down pack vertical Backfill thermoplastic Temporary IRM placed Removing damn, bite gently on this cotton roll so the jaw relaxes. Patient, it's over? That felt like 15 minutes Doctor, 55 minutes chair time Let me take a final x-ray, perfect taper, no overfill You did great. Jen will go over post-op instructions. Any soreness? Patient, just feels bruised, like I chewed aluminum. Doctor, normal Keep the ibuprofen schedule, cold compress 10 minutes on, 10 off, the next 4 hours No crunchy tacos tonight, think yogurt, pasta, scrambled eggs Patient, easy enough When do I schedule the crown? Doctor, front desk has my open slots Ideally within a month If the temporary breaks, call us 24-7 answering service and we'll patch it same day. Patient, thank you, doctor I wish I'd done this sooner Doctor, most patients say that You took the hardest step, showing up We'll see you at the crown prep, and don't forget to keep training for that 10k. Patient, will do Thanks again
