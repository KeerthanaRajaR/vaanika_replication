 Doctor, since the tooth is missing, a dental implant is a good option. Patient, is an implant permanent? Doctor, yes, it functions like a natural tooth. Patient, how is it placed? Doctor, a titanium post is placed in the jawbone, followed by a crown. Patient, how long does the process take? Doctor, a few months including healing time. Patient, is it painful? Doctor, mild discomfort that is manageable. Patient, I want a long-term solution. Doctor, implants are ideal for that. Thank you.
